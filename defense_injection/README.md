# Injecting backdoor signatures

Inject backdoors into a model so that adversarial examples can be detected by
looking for the fingerprints of a backdoor.

## Defense Idea



## Training



## Objectives

Our best attack results are as follows, when evaluated on the first 100 images
in the CIFAR-10 test set using the provided pretrained model..
- l_infinity distortion of 4/255: TODO attack success rate
- l_2 distortion of TODO: TODO attack success rate

### Defenses

This bit-depth quantization idea has been published many times in the past.
The earliest paper which proposed (something like) it is TODO.
